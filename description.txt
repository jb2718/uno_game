UNO

Game Flow
----------
1. deal cards and set first discard card

2. player 1 follows instructions of discard card OR discards a card OR adds a card to hand

3. player 2 follows instructions of discard card OR discards a card OR adds a card to hand

4. Repeat 2 & 3 until first player runs out of cards

OOP Breakdown - 
Step 1: Write description of problem
------------------------------------------
- Uno is a game for 2 players where players start with 7 cards each and try to get rid of their cards first

- A player can get rid of cards in 2 ways:

  1. match the color, number, symbol of the top discard card

  2. use a wild card

- Cards are added to a player's hand in 2 ways:
  
  1. at the start of player's turn, she has no matches to the top discard card in her hand OR she chooses not to play any of the cards she has
    - player must pull one card from the deck

  2. at the start of a player's turn, the top card on the discard pile commands her to add cards to her hand
    - player must pull however many cards she is commanded to pull from the deck

- Aside from adding and discarding cards to players' hands, there is one more thing to consider - the game flow.  There are special cards that allow players to alter the flow of the game:
  - skip: skips a player's turn
  - reverse: reverses the flow of turns
  - the color to match can be arbitrarily changed with a wild card

OOP Breakdown - 
Step 2: Extract major nouns and verbs from
the description
------------------------------------------

Nouns
------
game, player, card, color, number, symbol, discard card, wild card, hand, turn, match, deck, flow

Verbs
-----
add card, start, get rid of card, match card, pull card, choose, command, alter flow, skip, reverse, change color


------------------------------------------
OOP Breakdown - 
Step 3: Group verbs with the nouns they
are associated with
------------------------------------------

Game: { start, deal cards (this is implicit in 'players start with 7 cards...see #1 of game flow section') }

Player: { add card/pull card, get rid of card, choose }

Card: { match card }
- these are more like attributes of a card: Color, Number, Symbol
- these are types of cards: Discard card, Wild card

Hand: {  }

Turn: {}

Match: {}

Deck: {}

Flow: { alter flow, skip, reverse, change color }

Loose Verb:
command --> should this be something a card does?  or will the game tell the player to do it?


------------------------------------------
OOP Breakdown - 
Step 4: Set up skeleton classes and 
methods, where nouns = classes and 
verbs = methods in the classes
